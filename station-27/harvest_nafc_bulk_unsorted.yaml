# ERDDAP dataset variable that defines the filename
variable: id

# A list of file types to be identified
# 
# extension: the file extension that the regex pattern should be applied 
#            to (can be a regex in itself)
# 
# file_pattern: a regex used to identify and extract groups for replacement in 
#               output paths
# 
# groups: 1 or more named groups that can be extracted from file_pattern, they 
#         will be refernced in the data_root and output_root paths, such 
#         groups will be referenced by using double underscores (__) before and
#         after the group names in those paths.
#         Example: a group named "test" would be referenced as "__test__"
file_conventions:
  - {

# Root directory of source files
data_root: /srv/data/erddap/dfo/nafc/ctd/bulk_unsorted/__year__

# Root output directory for the generated symlinks
output_root: ./test-links/station_27_dataset/bulk_unsorted/__year__

# Valid values can be "symlink" or "ncml", if left blank, "symlink" is assumed as 
# a default value.
output_type: symlink

# (OPTIONAL)
# If output_type = ncml, then the following can be used to specify the name of 
# the ncml file, otherwise it defaults to the value of dataset with .ncml 
# appended.
# 
# NOTE: This value is ignored if output_type = "symlink"
ncml_filename: test_file.ncml

# (OPTIONAL)
# The following two settings reflect the nature of creating symlinks to be 
# referenced by ERDDAP running in a docker container.  The symlinks need to 
# point to where the files WILL BE in the container and not necessarily on the 
# host system.
# 
# As such, the root of those links must be substituted to locations that don't 
# exist on the host system but where they will be found inside of docker.
# 
# NOTE: Both values must be specified for this feature to operate

# Directory prefix to be replaced
real_output_root: /srv/data/erddap

# Replacement value for real_output_root
